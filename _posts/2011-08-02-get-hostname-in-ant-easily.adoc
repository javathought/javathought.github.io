After searching a while, here is the best way I found to get the hostname in a propert. Just use exec task :

[source,xml]
<exec dir="${basedir}" executable="hostname" outputproperty="host.name">


The trick is the attribute outputpropety of the exec task. You can then use ${host.name} variable to use the hostname in your ant scripts.
