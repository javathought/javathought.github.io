As said in my previous post, I've made a factory reset to my Galaxy S. So I want to reinstall my apps ... and Aspahtl 5 from SamsungApps. But it's not in the list of apps.

In fact, it's a bit hidden. You have to go to Menu -> Download, and you'll see previous installed apps, included Aspahalt 5.

*Edit* : by the way, I found it now on the market and there's a free version !
