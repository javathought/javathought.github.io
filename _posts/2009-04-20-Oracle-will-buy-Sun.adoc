Finally, that's Oracle that will buy Sun, surprisingly ahead of others companies, after persistant rumors of exchange with IBM.

Thus, Oracle will acquire new activities to concurrence their competitors. Especially, the sun server activity as Oracle didn't ship hardware before. A good news to Sun's customers. They will also acquire concurrent activity of their actual solutions, as MySql.

Personally, I'm particularly interested in the future of Netbeans, of course. And also, the raise of VirtualBox. Will they improve the solution to compete with VMWare ?
