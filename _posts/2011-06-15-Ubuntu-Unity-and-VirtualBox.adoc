I have a dual boot Windows7 / Ubuntu 11 on my recent laptop and I started enjoying Unity. I also installed VirtualBox on W7 to make tests on n-tier servers.

On these virtual installations of Ubuntu I couldn't have the Unity interface : the reason is simple, Unity need graphic acceleration, so do not forget to check the graphic acceleration in the configuration of your virtual machine.
