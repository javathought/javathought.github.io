= Ubuntu server & keyboard

I installed ubuntu 11.04 server but the keyboard was 'us'. Not quite efficient with my french one.

Searching on the web, it's often said to use :

[source,bash]
dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

But in fact, I didn't found a keyboard option.

Just launch :

[source,bash]
sudo loadkeys fr
