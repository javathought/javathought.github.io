In http://javathought.github.io/2012/07/04/play-and-3-tier-n-tier-architecture-part-i/[Part I], I introduced the use of Play! framework on 3-tier architecture. In this one, we will see how to use the native  features of Play! to implement a 3-tier application.

As we saw, the implementation of the *Logic tier* is easy with Play!. In this implementation, you can remove http://javathought.github.io/2011/12/04/cross-origin-resource-sharing-with-play-framework/[CORS] on the tier.

The *Presentation tier* will also be relatively easy; the Logic tier will be considered as the model of the Presentation tier : the diagram below illustrated the architecture.

Instead of making calls to a classic Play! model (such as <code>Account.findAll()</code>), the  controller will  call the REST API of the logic tier, and render a view as a response :

[code language="java"]

public static void accounts() \{

String url = "http://localhost:9011/api/accounts";

HttpResponse response = WS.url(url).get();

JsonElement accounts = response.getJson();

render(accounts);

[/code]

The view code will be a classic html template code. There's just a trick, as strings will be surrounded by quotes ("). The code will be <code>$\{object.property.getAsString()}</code> instead of <code>$\{object.property.getAsString()}</code>.

[code language="groovy"]

$\{account.number.getAsString()}

[/code]

And that's all. Really simple to make a 3-tier application with Play!
