As I promised in July, Â a little note to write better ant scripts.

Following comments on my previous post (http://javathought.github.io/2009/06/09/reusable-ant-build-file/), I finally arrived on this http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/j1sessn.jsp?sessn=TS-4166&yr=2009&track=javase[excellent presentation] from Douglas Bullard at JavaOne 2009. Read it, it will really improve you scripts.

The basis is to use the import.
