= Set up a ftp server in windows 7
:published_at: 2011-05-22

To make tests on my application, I needed a ftp server. On my previous desktop with XP, I installed a free frtp server. So I thought I'll make on my new Windows 7 computer. But there's an embedded server in Windows 7.

Just go to "**Control panel**" then "**Programs**" and "**Turn windows features on or off**". You'll just have to go down to "**Internet Information Services**" (or IIS) and select *FTP Server* AND **IIS management console**. See the screenshot below (in french) :

Then you have to administrate your IIS : in control panel, click **System and Security**, and then click *Administrative Tools* and launch **IIS Manager**. There just add a FTP site (right click on the *Sites* folder).

1. Enter a name for the site and the file path to the directory that will host your site

image::win7_ftp_site1.png?w=300[image,title="Win7_ftp_site1"]

[start=2]
2. Enter the properties for the connection to the site

[start=3]
3. Enter the authentifications rules (authentification mode, anonymous connection, read/write access)

And you're gone with your ftp site : no download, run as a service; the hard part is to know it's included in Windows 7 and where to find it.
