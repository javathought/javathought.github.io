= Hello Java world!
:published_at: 2009-04-15


Welcome to http://javathought.github.io[JavaThought].

I'm Pascal and this blog is a new one where I'll post all my notes about Java. I could also write old stuff about Java that I wrote elsewhere to keep only one place for my writings about Java.

This will also be a place to stock my sniplets.

Hope I'll see you soon back here.
