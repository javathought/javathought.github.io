Before giving the second part of [my last post, a quick how-to to add great looking buttons in your applications with http://sass-lang.com/[sass] (an extension of CSS3) and http://brandonmathis.com/blog/2009/11/19/fancy-buttons-are-here/[fancy-buttons] (an easy way to design CSS buttons in seconds) .

there a sass module in play. Just type the following line to get the module. It comes with fancy-buttons embedded.

[code laguage="ksh"]

play install sass

[/code]

Don't forget to run eclipsify (or the command of your IDE) again and refresh Eclipse (your IDE). I'll make this how-to on my datepicker project (from previous post).

Add the module to your application in conf/application.conf :

[code language="ini"]

module.sass=$\{play.path}/modules/sass-head

[/code]

Not you just have two files to modify.

Create the sass stylesheet (main.sass) in /public/stylesheets. Import fancy-buttons and "style" your submit button :

[code language="css"]

@import fancy_buttons.sass

input[type="submit"]

+fancy-button

[/code]

Really simple, isn't it ?

Add the call to the stylesheet in main.html :

[code language="html"]

<link rel="stylesheet" href="@\{'public/stylesheets/main.sass'}" type="text/css">

[/code]

And, _voil√†_ :
