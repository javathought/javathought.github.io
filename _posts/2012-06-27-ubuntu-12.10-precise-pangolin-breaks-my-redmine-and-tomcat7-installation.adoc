My redmine installation was broken when I installed Precise pangolin. The home screen was ok, but I has errors when navigating on the app. I didn't search much but found easyli the solution when I tried to install a package. I had errors when running __sudo apt-get install ...__. These errors where about the command _rake db:migrate_ and the tomcat file tomcat-users.xml.

So the action about ruby was easy :

[code language="bash"]

sudo gem install --remote rake

[/code]

For tomcat 7, I had a previous manual installation on ubuntu 11. As tomcat 7 is embedded with precise pangolin, I just had to copy the file missing fomr my previous manual installation :

[code language="bash"]

sudo cp /opt/tomcat7/conf/tomcat-users.xml /etc/tomcat7

[/code]
