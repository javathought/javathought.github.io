If you encountered an errorÂ  in this chapter, calling the managedQuery function, the easy to find http://p2p.wrox.com/book-professional-android-2-application-development/82392-chapter-5-contact-picker-example.html[correction is mentioned here] on editor "p2p" (programmer to programmer) site.

More interesting info is the replacement of the use of the deprecated class People.

But this don't mention the correction for the "Force close" when launching the app on Android 2.3.3.
