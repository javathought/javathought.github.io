The Hudson choice of a blue ball for successful build isn't a classic choice. You'd prefer a class green ball (like traffic light) : just use http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Green+Balls[green ball plugin] !

To have a http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins[list of Hudson plugin], just visit the http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Home[hudson wiki].
